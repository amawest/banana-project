# Context
The most environmentally-friendly way of transporting certain foods intercontinentally is through the use of reefers. A reefer, or a refrigerated ship used for overseas transport of perishable goods, constitute the main source of transport for the banana trade. It was the invention of the refrigerated reefer ship that first brought Jamaican bananas to the English in 1897. Before then, bananas could only be shipped relatively short distances. This graph takes a look at the banana exports by various countries between 1994 - 2005. Data is derived from the United States Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
